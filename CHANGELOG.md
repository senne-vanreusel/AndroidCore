### Custom Views

### Breaking

- Moved Core to a proper module, now a better abstraction can be achieved by adding more submodules to Core. Even a sample app can be created within this project as well. Details of the procedure can be found [here](https://appwise.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~635004520/pages/415989761/Android+Core+Multiple+Submodules).
- Networking, Realm and Room have been moved to separate modules as well.

- Removed 'easyValidation' dependency as it was a deprecated library that was only available on JCenter.

### Improvements

- Added the possibility to override the BaseRestClient's `getHttpLoggingInterceptor()` to provide a project specific logging level.

### New Features

- Added Double and Tripple triggers for LiveData.

### Breaking

- Removed Realm from AndroidCore and replaced it with Room.
- Updated `EasyImage` dependency which had breaking changes in some of our Extension functions.
- Updated a lot of dependencies where a couple of them had some breaking changes, not major but still (functions turned to parameters).
- Using `BaseBindingVMFragment`, `BaseVMFragment`, `BaseBindingVMActivity` or `BaseVMActivity` won't require you to add the ViewModel as a generic object

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with our `parseError` where we didn't want to use a new Retorfit instance.
- FadingEdge will now work when adding padding to the `RecyclerViewEmptyLoadingSupport`.
- `kotlin_version` added to `build.gradle` so our dependabot won't fail it's builds.

- Extension function `setupRecyclerView` is now more flexible.
- Changed expected type of `id` from `Int` to `Any`

### Improvements

- Added an `extraLogoutStep()` in `BaseNetworkingListeners` so it's easier to potentially keep some values in Hawk when logging out.
- Added possibility to provide a custom `idColumnInfo` when needed in the `BaseDao`, default value will still be `id`
- Added possibility to add multiple ApiServices to a RestClient (possibility to use different baseUrl as well)

### Internal
